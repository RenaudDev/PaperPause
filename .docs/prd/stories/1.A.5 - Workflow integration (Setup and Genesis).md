# 1.A.5 — Workflow integration (Setup & Genesis)

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Integrate Foreman + Designer into the GitHub Actions workflow as a gated setup stage without destabilizing production.

## Scope
- Add a Setup & Genesis job that:
  - runs Foreman (produces matrix)
  - runs Designer for each matrix item (dry-run first, then write-mode)

## Acceptance criteria
- When `ENABLE_FOREMAN=0`, the workflow uses the existing hardcoded matrix unchanged.
- When `ENABLE_FOREMAN=1`, the workflow uses Foreman output as the matrix.
- When `ENABLE_DESIGNER=0`, no auto-genesis runs.
- When `DESIGNER_DRY_RUN=1`, Designer produces reports only.
- Any files created/modified by Designer are included in the artifact/commit strategy (no “lost changes”).

## Rollback
- Toggle Foreman/Designer off (feature flags).
- Revert created files via git if needed.
