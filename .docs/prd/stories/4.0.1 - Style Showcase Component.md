# 4.0.1 — Style Showcase Component

Epic: `4 - Collection Content Engine`

## Goal
Create a visual container shortcode `{{< style-showcase >}}` to display and explain specific artistic styles within a collection.

## Scope
-   Create `themes/visual-sanctuary-theme/layouts/shortcodes/style-showcase.html`.
-   Implement responsive styling using vanilla CSS (matching `main.css`).
-   Include support for `src`, `title`, and `description` parameters.

## Acceptance criteria
-   Shortcode renders a themed `<figure>` with an image and caption.
-   Supports Cloudflare Images URLs (`imagedelivery.net`).
-   Includes subtle hover effects (e.g., `scale`) as per PRD specs.
-   Gracefully handles long descriptions without breaking the layout.

## Rollback
-   Delete the shortcode file.
-   Remove references from any manual test pages.
