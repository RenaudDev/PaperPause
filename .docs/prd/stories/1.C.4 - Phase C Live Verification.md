# 1.C.4 — Phase C Live Verification

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Verify JIT Finishing and PDF generation.

## Steps
1. **Deploy**: `ENABLE_FINISHING=1`, `ENABLE_PDF=1` (Strict JIT).
2. **Trigger Workflow**.
3. **Verify**:
   - **Rejected Assets** (if any): Have NO PDFs on R2.
   - **Survivors**: Have PDFs on R2.
   - **Markdown**: `download_url` points to the valid PDF.
   - **Idempotency**: Re-running the workflow does not create duplicate `.md` files or "copy 2" assets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- PDFs exist only for passed assets.
- Content naming is stable.
- Reruns are clean.
