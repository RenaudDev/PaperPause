# 1.A.3 — Designer (Auto-Genesis) dry-run

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Allow safe preview of Auto-Genesis actions (creating missing category/collection scaffolding) without making changes.

## Scope
- For each scheduled `category/collection` (including `dry_run_collections`):
  - validate whether collection exists
  - report what would be created/updated (bounded scope)

## Outputs
- Human-readable dry-run report (workflow summary + logs).

## Acceptance criteria
- With `DESIGNER_DRY_RUN=1`, no files are created or modified.
- Report includes:
  - whether `content/<category>/<collection>/` exists
  - whether `_index.md` exists
  - whether prompt config exists (location/schema TBD but must be consistent)
  - what new files would be created
  - clear labeling of dry-run-only collections (e.g., Fantasy Week 1) vs production collections

## Rollback
- N/A (dry-run has no side effects).
