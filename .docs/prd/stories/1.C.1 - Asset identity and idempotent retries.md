# 1.C.1 — Asset identity + idempotent retries

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Make the pipeline retry-safe: reruns do not create duplicate uploads or duplicate markdown files.

## Core decision
Introduce a stable **AssetID** and treat all writes as **upserts**.

## Requirements
- AssetID is deterministic per scheduled output slot (week/date + category + collection + slot).
- A manifest/ledger exists that records the mapping from AssetID → final outputs (md path, r2 keys, etc.).
- Deduplication applies to:
  - Issue #4 logs (don’t log the same failure twice for same AssetID/run_id)
  - content markdown (don’t generate duplicates)
  - storage uploads (same key overwrite/no-op policy)

## Acceptance criteria
- Re-running the same run does not create extra markdown files.
- Re-running does not create extra PDFs/PNGs with new keys for the same AssetID.
- The system can detect “already finished” and skip work.
