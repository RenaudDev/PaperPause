# 1.A.2 — Foreman: `production-schedule.ts`

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Generate the daily matrix deterministically from the rollout schedule file and maintenance throttling rules.

## Inputs
- Rollout schedule: `mission-control/rollout-schedule.md`
- Current date/time (ET boundary rule)
- Repo content counts (published pages per collection)

## Outputs
- Machine-readable matrix output used by GitHub Actions (list of `category/collection`).
- Optional: per-collection scheduling reason (daily vs weekly due to cap) for workflow summary.

## Rules
- Select active collections for the current week from schedule file.
- Apply maintenance throttling:
  - If `published_count < 75`: daily
  - If `published_count >= 75`: only schedule on first daily run after week starts
- Never require persisted “already ran this week” state (deterministic Monday rule).

## Acceptance criteria
- Same inputs (schedule + date) → same matrix output.
- Capped collections are included only on the first run of the week.
- Uncapped collections are included daily.
- Output includes Fantasy collections even if they do not yet exist in `content/` (Designer will create them).

## Rollback
- Set `ENABLE_FOREMAN=0` to revert to workflow hardcoded matrix.
