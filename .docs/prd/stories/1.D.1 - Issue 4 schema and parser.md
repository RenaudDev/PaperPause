# 1.D.1 — Issue #4 schema + parser

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Make Issue #4 (“Trash Can”) a reliable machine ledger for QA failures and rejections.

## Scope
- Standardize the `trashcan_v1` comment schema (JSON fenced block).
- Implement a parser that extracts the JSON block even if extra human text exists above/below.

## Acceptance criteria
- Parser can read historical Issue #4 comments and build a dataset keyed by:
  - `asset_id`, `run_id`, `category`, `collection`, `reason`
- Schema changes require an explicit `schema_version` bump.

## Rollback
- If parsing fails, fall back to “no immunization changes” and log an alert; do not guess.
