# 2.0.1 - Prompt Pipeline Hygiene

**Epic**: `2 - Content Quality & Scaling`

## Goal
Eliminate "instruction drift" and token waste by centralizing safety/negative logic and cleaning up configuration files.

## Scope
- **Refactor `prompt-manager.ts`**:
    - Remove hardcoded technical specs from the text prompt (`aspectRatio = "3:4"`, `Resolution: "4K"`). Let the API config handle this.
    - Remove the generated string "No shading, no text, no gray" from the `negative_prompt` construction.
- **Clean JSON Configs**:
    - Iterate through all `config/prompts/*.json`.
    - Delete generic negative terms from the `base` and `negative_prompt` fields.
    - *Note*: Keep subject-specific anatomical negatives (e.g., "extra legs" for horses).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `prompt-manager.ts` no longer appends hardcoded aspect ratio or resolution to the text prompt.
- [ ] `prompt-manager.ts` no longer constructs generic "No shading/text" negative prompts (relying on `CRITIC_SAFETY_BLOCK` in `gemini.ts`).
- [ ] All `config/prompts/*.json` files have been scrubbed of generic negative terms.
- [ ] Generated prompts in logs show a cleaner signal without redundant negative instruction.

## Rollback
- Revert changes to `prompt-manager.ts` and the JSON configuration files.
