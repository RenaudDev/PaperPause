# 1.E.6 — Phase E Live Verification

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Validate that the distribution system works end-to-end, from scheduler to Pinterest, with zero manual touches.

## Scope
- Trigger `scheduler` job via GitHub Actions.
- Verify `distribution-queue.json` is generated correctly.
- Trigger `distributor` job manually.
- Verify Make.com scenario executes:
  - Board created (if new).
  - Pin created with correct image and link.
- Verify subsequent hourly triggers pop items from the queue correctly.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Zero-Touch Scaling:** Adding a new folder `content/animals/unicorns` results in a board creation.
- [ ] **State Awareness:** >75 posts collections throttle correctly.
- [ ] **Idempotency:** Queue pops successfully and saves before/during fire.
- [ ] **Live Pin:** A live Pinterest pin exists with the correct PaperPause URL and image.
