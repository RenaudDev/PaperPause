# 1.E.3 — Night Watchman scheduler and queue schema

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Implement the "Brain" of the distribution system: a midnight scheduler that audits content and builds a deterministic queue for the day.

## Scope
- Implement `scripts/morning-routine/tasks/midnight-scheduler.ts`.
- **Logic:**
  - Scan `content/animals/*`.
  - **Growth Rule:** posts < 75 → Schedule Daily.
  - **Maintenance Rule:** posts ≥ 75 → Schedule Weekly (Deterministic hash-based day selection).
  - **JIT Naming:** Generate `board_name` (e.g., `sharks` → "Shark Coloring Pages").
- **State Management:** Overwrite `config/distribution-queue.json`.

## Acceptance criteria
- `midnight-scheduler.ts` correctly identifies growth vs maintenance collections.
- `distribution-queue.json` is generated with valid JSON structure.
- The queue contains the correct collections based on the current date and content counts.
- Board names are correctly title-cased and appended with " Coloring Pages".
