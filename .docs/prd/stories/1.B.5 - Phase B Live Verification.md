# 1.B.5 — Phase B Live Verification

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Verify Critic QA logs and later, Fail-Fast enforcement.

## Steps (B1: Observe)
1. **Deploy**: `ENABLE_QA=1`, `QA_MODE=observe`.
2. **Trigger Workflow**.
3. **Verify**:
   - QA runs on generated assets.
   - Logs show "QA Result" but **no assets are rejected**.
   - Production proceeds normally.

## Steps (B2: Fail-Fast)
1. **Deploy**: `QA_MODE=enforce_failfast`.
2. **Trigger Workflow** (potentially with a forced bad prompt to test failure).
3. **Verify**:
   - Failing asset is **Rejected** (moved to `rejected/`).
   - **Issue #4** receives a structured log.
   - **Collection Halts**: confirms no further assets generated for that specific collection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- QA logs are visible in Observe mode.
- Rejects/Halt occur in Fail-Fast mode.
- Issue #4 logs are machine-parseable.
