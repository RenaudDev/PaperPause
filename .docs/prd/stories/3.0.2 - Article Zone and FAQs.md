# 3.0.2 — Article Zone and FAQs

**Epic**: `3 - Collection UX Overhaul`

## Goal
Add a Medium.com-style content section BELOW the gallery for long-form SEO articles and implement visual accordions for FAQs.

## Scope

### Template Changes (`list.html`)
- Add Article Zone section AFTER the gallery container.
- **FAQ Partial**: Create or include logic to render FAQs.
    - Pattern: Detect a specific markdown header (e.g., `## FAQ` or `## Frequently Asked Questions`) or look for a dedicated `.Params.faqs` field.
    - Component: Tailored accordion (summary/details or JS-based) for questions and answers.

### CSS Updates
- **Medium.com Style**: Centered container (`max-w-3xl`), large `text-lg` prose.
- **FAQ Accordion**:
    - Bordered or shaded backgrounds for question headers.
    - Smooth expansion for answers.
    - Style to match PaperPause teal design system.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Content after `<!--more-->` delimiter renders correctly in the Article Zone.
- [ ] Prose styling follows high-readability patterns (centered, generous spacing).
- [ ] FAQs render as visually distinct accordions/toggle sections.
- [ ] FAQ content is indexable but doesn't clutter the page until opened.

## Rollback
- Revert additions to `list.html` and the Article Zone styles.
