# 1.E.4 — Distribution Conductor and Webhook integration

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Implement the "Executor" script that processes the daily queue and triggers the Make.com distribution scenario.

## Scope
- [ ] Implement `scripts/morning-routine/tasks/distribution-conductor.ts`.
- **Logic:**
  - Read `config/distribution-queue.json`.
  - Pop the first item from the queue.
  - POST JSON payload to `MAKE_WEBHOOK` (from env).
  - **Authentication**: Send `MAKE_WEBHOOK_API` (from env) in `x-make-apikey` header.
  - Update and save the queue file (idempotency: pop first, then save).
- Ensure the script handles network errors gracefully without losing queue state until successful fire.

## Acceptance criteria
- `distribution-conductor.ts` successfully pops and fires the webhook.
- The `distribution-queue.json` file is updated correctly after ഓരോ distribution.
- Missing `MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL` secret causes a clear error but doesn't corrupt the queue.
