# 1.B.3 — Rejection sink + Issue #4 logging

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
When QA fails, route rejected assets to a stable rejected location and log a machine-parseable record to Issue #4.

## Scope
- R2 rejected key convention: `rejected/<category>/<collection>/<asset_id>.png` (exact suffixing can be refined, but must be deterministic).
- Issue #4 comment schema: `trashcan_v1` JSON block.

## Required Issue #4 fields (minimum)
- `schema_version`, `timestamp_utc`, `run_id`, `asset_id`, `category`, `collection`, `qa_mode`, `qa_result`, `reason`, `reason_details`, `image_url`, `r2_original`

## Acceptance criteria
- Every rejected asset creates exactly one Issue #4 comment (dedupe by `asset_id` + `run_id`).
- Comments include a fenced ```json block (strict JSON, parseable).
- Rejected assets are accessible via the logged URL.

## Rollback
- Disable QA (`ENABLE_QA=0`) to stop creating rejects.
