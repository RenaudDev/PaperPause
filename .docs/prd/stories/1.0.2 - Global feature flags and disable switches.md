# 1.0.2 — Global feature flags and disable switches

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Ensure every autonomy capability can be turned on/off safely without breaking the baseline workflow.

## Scope
- Define and document a consistent set of flags used by workflow + scripts.
- Engineering rules for any code changes in this Epic: `.ai-rules.md` (especially Hugo layout hierarchy; do not modify root `layouts/`).

## Proposed flags (minimum)
- `ENABLE_FOREMAN` (default 0)
- `ENABLE_DESIGNER` (default 0)
- `DESIGNER_DRY_RUN` (default 1)
- `ENABLE_QA` (default 0)
- `QA_MODE` (`observe` or `enforce_failfast`)
- `ENABLE_FINISHING` (default 0)
- `ENABLE_PDF` (default 0 until strict JIT is implemented)
- `ENABLE_IMMUNIZATION` (default 0)

## Week 1 Fantasy dry-run configuration (recommended)
- Goal: run Foreman + Designer to see what would be created for `fantasy/*`, without generating/publishing Fantasy assets.
- Schedule file: Week 1 puts Fantasy into `dry_run_collections` (not `collections`).
- Flags:
  - `ENABLE_FOREMAN=1`
  - `ENABLE_DESIGNER=1`
  - `DESIGNER_DRY_RUN=1`
  - Keep production generation/publishing for Fantasy off by ensuring Foreman never includes `dry_run_collections` in the production matrix.

## Acceptance criteria
- With all flags OFF, the workflow behavior matches the baseline contract exactly.
- Flags are surfaced in workflow summary output and documented in PRD/rollout.

## Rollback
- Rollback is always “toggle OFF” for the capability.
