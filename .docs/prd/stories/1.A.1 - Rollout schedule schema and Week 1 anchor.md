# 1.A.1 — Rollout schedule schema and Week 1 anchor

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Make Foreman scheduling deterministic by locking the rollout schedule schema and anchoring Week 1 Day 1.

## Scope
- The rollout schedule file is the source of truth for which collections are active each week.

## Requirements
- Schema: `rollout_schedule_v1`
- Timezone: `America/New_York`
- Week boundary: Monday 00:01 ET
- Week 1 start: **2025-12-22 (ET)**
- Week 1 includes: **Animals (current)** + **Fantasy**

## Acceptance criteria
- The schedule file has:
  - `starts_at_et` values that are real Mondays (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - explicit `collections` and (if used) `dry_run_collections` (no “etc.” placeholders).
  - Week 1 includes Fantasy as `dry_run_collections` (Foreman/Designer dry-run only), not in production `collections`.
  - no ambiguity between “example” vs “driver” usage.

## Rollback
- Revert schedule changes via git; Foreman falls back to hardcoded matrix when `ENABLE_FOREMAN=0`.
