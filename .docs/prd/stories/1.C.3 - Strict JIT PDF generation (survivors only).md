# 1.C.3 — Strict JIT PDF generation (survivors only)

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Stop generating PDFs during initial upload; generate PDFs only after QA passes (survivors only).

## Context
Today PDF generation happens during upload, which wastes cost on rejected images. PRD decision: **Strict JIT**.

## Scope
- Move PDF generation to the Finisher step (post-QA) where final naming is known.
- Ensure PDF naming is deterministic and tied to AssetID/slug.

## Acceptance criteria
- Rejected assets do not get PDFs.
- Survivors always attempt PDF generation in Finisher.
- PDF generation is retry-safe (upsert semantics).

## Rollback
- Temporarily disable PDF generation via `ENABLE_PDF=0` if needed while keeping PNG publishing functional.
