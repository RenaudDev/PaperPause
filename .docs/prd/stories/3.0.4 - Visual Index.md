# 3.0.4 — Visual Index

**Epic**: `3 - Collection UX Overhaul`

## Goal
Create a dense, visually appealing grid of square tiles for parent collection pages (e.g., `/animals/`) that maximizes above-the-fold density and collection discovery.

## Scope
- **Create Partial** (`partials/visual-index.html`):
  - Render child sections/collections as 1:1 aspect ratio square tiles.
  - Each tile includes:
    - Background image (from collection's `_index.md` `image` frontmatter or first child image).
    - Text overlay with collection title.
    - Hover effect (optional: slight zoom, overlay darkening).
  - Link each tile to its collection page.

- **Conditionally Render in `list.html`**:
  - Detect if current page is a "parent" section (has child sections, not leaf pages).
  - If parent: render Visual Index partial instead of standard gallery grid.
  - If leaf collection: render standard gallery grid.

- **CSS Updates**:
  - Grid layout for 1:1 tiles (CSS Grid with fixed aspect ratio).
  - Responsive: 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on tablet, 1-2 on mobile.
  - Text overlay styling (semi-transparent background, legible typography).
  - Hover transitions.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Parent collection pages (e.g., `/animals/`) render child collections as square tiles.
- [ ] Each tile displays collection title as text overlay.
- [ ] Each tile has a background image from the collection.
- [ ] Tiles maintain 1:1 aspect ratio across breakpoints.
- [ ] Clicking a tile navigates to the target collection.
- [ ] Hover effect provides visual feedback.
- [ ] Leaf collection pages continue to render standard gallery (not Visual Index).
- [ ] Layout is responsive and visually balanced.

## Rollback
- Remove the `visual-index.html` partial.
- Revert conditional logic in `list.html`.
- Revert associated CSS changes.
