# 2.0.3 - Content Refinement

**Epic**: `2 - Content Quality & Scaling`

## Goal
Fix the weakest collections using the new occupancy logic and refined content settings.

## Scope
- **Butterflies (`animals-butterflies.json`)**:
    - **Settings**: Replace "sky/garden" with macro objects: "cluster of blooming peonies", "intricate mandala of leaves", "glass jar with fireflies".
    - **Actions**: Remove "flying" (implies distance). Add "resting on leaf", "sipping nectar".
- **Sharks (`animals-sharks.json`)**:
    - **Tones**: Visualize abstract tones. Change "Cool / Swaggy" to "Cool / Swaggy (wearing sunglasses)".
    - **Settings**: Ensure enclosure. "Inside sunken ship captain's quarters" vs "Ocean".

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `animals-butterflies.json` config is successfully updated with new settings and actions.
- [ ] `animals-sharks.json` config is successfully updated with new tones and settings.
- [ ] Test runs for butterflies show macro views (no distant flying).
- [ ] Test runs for sharks show specific "Cool" attributes and enclosed settings.

## Rollback
- Revert `animals-butterflies.json` and `animals-sharks.json` to their previous state.
