# 1.E.2 — Make.com scenario configuration + monitoring

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Configure Make.com to act as the "Hands" of the distribution system, managing Pinterest boards dynamically without human intervention.

## Scope
- [x] Create `Board_Mappings` data store in Make.com (5MB storage ready).
- [ ] Implement "Smart Router" logic to:
  - Check Data Store for board ID.
  - Create board via Pinterest API if missing.
  - Update Data Store with new Board ID.
  - Pull RSS feed and Create Pin.
- [x] Expose a secure Webhook URL for the GitHub Conductor.
- [ ] Verify Webhook authentication (using `x-make-apikey` header).

### Webhook Payload Schema
The GitHub Conductor will send the following JSON payload:
```json
{
  "collection": "dogs",
  "board_name": "Dog Coloring Pages",
  "rss_url": "https://paperpause.app/animals/dogs/index.xml"
}
```

## Acceptance criteria
- Webhook successfully triggers the scenario with a `collection` and `board_name` payload.
- Scenario correctly creates a new board if it doesn't exist and pins the latest image from RSS.
- Board IDs are successfully cached in the `Board_Mappings` Data Store.
