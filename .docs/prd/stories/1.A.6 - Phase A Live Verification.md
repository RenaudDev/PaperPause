# 1.A.6 — Phase A Live Verification

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Verify Foreman and Designer integration in the live environment.

## Steps
1. **Deploy**: Push changes enabling Foreman (`ENABLE_FOREMAN=1`) and Designer (`ENABLE_DESIGNER=1`, `DESIGNER_DRY_RUN=1`).
2. **Trigger Workflow**: Run `daily-generate-and-optimize`.
3. **Verify Logs**:
   - **Foreman**: Confirm the matrix was generated dynamically from `mission-control/rollout-schedule.md`.
   - **Designer (Dry Run)**: Confirm logs show "Would create..." for missing collections (e.g. `fantasy/*`) but **did not** modify files.
4. **Verify Artifacts**:
   - Matrix job counts match the Foreman output.
   - No unexpected file changes committed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Foreman output matches the rollout schedule for the current week.
- Designer runs in dry-run mode and logs expected diffs.
- Production generation continues to work for existing collections.
