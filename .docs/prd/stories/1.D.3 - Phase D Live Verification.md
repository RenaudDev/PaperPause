# 1.D.3 — Phase D Live Verification

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Verify Architect Immunization logic.

## Steps
1. **Setup**: Ensure Issue #4 has some "recurring failures" (or seed test comments).
2. **Deploy**: `ENABLE_IMMUNIZATION=1`.
3. **Trigger Workflow** (Scheduled weekly run).
4. **Verify**:
   - Architect reads Issue #4.
   - Architect commits a config change (adding `negative_prompt` terms) if threshold met.
   - **Safety Check**: Verify prompt length did not exceed 500 chars (check logs).
   - **Rollback Check**: Manually revert the commit and verify system recovers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Immunization runs and creates a valid commit (or logs "no action needed").
- No config corruption.
