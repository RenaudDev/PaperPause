# 4.B.1 — Daily Content Sweep Workflow

Epic: `4 - Collection Content Engine`

## Goal
Integrate the content engine into the daily CI/CD pipeline as a decoupled, idempotent operation.

## Scope
-   Add `npm run content:sweep` to `package.json`.
-   Create `.github/workflows/daily-content-sweep.yml`.
-   Configure daily schedule (`0 7 * * *` UTC) and feature flag support.

## Acceptance criteria
-   Workflow runs daily with a 2-hour buffer after image generation.
-   Correctly uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` and other repo secrets.
-   Commits changes back to `main` ONLY if content was actually updated.
-   Produces a run manifest in `mission-control/logs/content-sweep-<date>.json`.

## Rollback
-   Disable or delete `.github/workflows/daily-content-sweep.yml`.
-   Remove the script from `package.json`.
