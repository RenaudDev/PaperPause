# 1.B.4 — Enforce QA fail-fast (1-strike)

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Enforce the 1-strike fail-fast rule: first QA failure rejects+logs and halts that collection for the remainder of the run.

## Behavior (authoritative)
- On first QA failure in a collection during a run:
  - reject asset
  - upload/move to rejected sink
  - log to Issue #4
  - stop generating further candidates for that collection in that run
- Other collections continue normally.

## Acceptance criteria
- With `QA_MODE=enforce_failfast`, one failure stops only that collection.
- A single Issue #4 record is created for the failing asset/collection halt.
- No further generation is attempted for that collection after the first failure.

## Rollback
- Set `QA_MODE=observe` or `ENABLE_QA=0`.
