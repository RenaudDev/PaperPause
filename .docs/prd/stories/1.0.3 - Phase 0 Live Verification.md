# 1.0.3 — Phase 0 Live Verification

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Verify the baseline pipeline behaves exactly as expected in the live GitHub Actions environment before beginning Phase A.

## Steps
1. **Ensure Baseline Code**: Verify `main` branch matches the "known good" state (no active Foreman/Designer logic, flags disabled).
2. **Trigger Workflow**: Run the `daily-generate-and-optimize` workflow manually (or wait for scheduled run).
3. **Verify Artifacts**:
   - Check the `summary` output of the GHA run.
   - Confirm `scripts/morning-routine/.runs/<runId>.json` was created.
   - Confirm content was generated and committed (or best-effort skipped) typically.
   - Confirm **Issue #1** (Legacy Tracker) received the run summary.
4. **Verify No Regressions**:
   - No "Foreman" or "Designer" logs should appear.
   - No "Trash Can" (Issue #4) posts should be created.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Workflow completes successfully (green).
- Legacy tracking issue (#1) is updated.
- No Autonomy V2 features (Foreman/Designer/QA) triggered.
