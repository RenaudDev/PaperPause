# Story: Distributed Maintenance Scheduling

## Context
Pinterest penalizes "spikes" in activity. Our previous logic scheduled all "Maintenance" collections (1/week) on Mondays, which would eventually create a massive spike (e.g., 50+ posts) on that day, triggering spam filters.

## Requirements
1. **Modify `production-schedule.ts`**:
   - Remove the `isMonday` logic for capped collections.
   - Implement a deterministic helper function `getCollectionDay(collection_name)` that returns 0-6.
   - Only schedule a capped collection if today's day index matches the collection's target day.

2. **Verify Distribution**:
   - Ensure that `cats` (example) always runs on the same day of the week.
   - Ensure that across 50 collections, the maintenance load is roughly even (approx 7 collections per day).

3. **Update Logging**:
   - Foreman logs should explicitly state: "Skipped (Wait for [DayName])" instead of just "Skipped".

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Running Foreman on Monday does NOT schedule every capped collection.
- [ ] Running Foreman on the specific hashed day for "cats" schedules "cats".
- [ ] The total production matrix size stays within the ~20-25 safe zone.
