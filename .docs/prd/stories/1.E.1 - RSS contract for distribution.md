# 1.E.1 — RSS contract for distribution

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Define a stable RSS “contract” for downstream syndication (Make.com) to ensure the Conductor has a reliable target to point to.

## Scope
- Define required fields for RSS items in `index.xml` for each collection:
  - `title`: Collection name + SEO suffix
  - `link`: Direct URL to the pattern page
  - `enclosure` or `media:content`: Direct URL to the high-res image
  - `description`: Structured text for Pinterest caption
- Implementation of RSS templates in Hugo (theme-first).

## Acceptance criteria
- Each collection generates a valid `index.xml`.
- RSS feed contains at least 5 stabilized items.
- Image URLs are reachable and point to the correct R2/Cloudflare assets.
