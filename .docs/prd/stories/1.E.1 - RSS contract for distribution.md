# 1.E.1 — RSS contract for distribution

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System`

## Goal
Define a stable RSS “contract” for downstream syndication (Make.com), without coupling syndication into the core autonomy loop.

## Scope
- Define required fields for RSS items:
  - title
  - page URL
  - image URL
  - description
  - optional UTM schema

## Acceptance criteria
- Sample RSS item meets the contract and is stable across builds.
