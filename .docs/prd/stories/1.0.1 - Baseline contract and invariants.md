# 1.0.1 — Baseline contract and invariants

Epic: `1 - PaperPause Autonomy System` (`.docs/prd/epics/1 - PaperPause Autonomy System.md`)

## Goal
Define the non-negotiable “known good” baseline for the daily pipeline so future rollout changes can be gated and safely rolled back.

## Context
Current pipeline exists in `.github/workflows/daily-generate-and-optimize.yml` and uses:
- `scripts/morning-routine/tasks/generate-batch.ts`
- `scripts/morning-routine/tasks/seo-review-batch.ts`

Engineering rules for any code changes in this Epic: `.ai-rules.md` (especially Hugo layout hierarchy; do not modify root `layouts/`).

## Scope
- Document current behavior and define invariants that must remain true across all phases.

## Non-goals
- No new scheduling, QA, or finishing logic yet.

## Acceptance criteria
- A baseline contract exists that explicitly states:
  - What the workflow does today (generate → best-effort SEO → commit).
  - What artifacts it produces (content markdown, manifest).
  - What failures are allowed to be best-effort (SEO).
  - What issue(s) are used today (Issue #1) and what autonomy will use for rejections (Issue #4).

## Rollback
- N/A (documentation only; baseline is the rollback target).
