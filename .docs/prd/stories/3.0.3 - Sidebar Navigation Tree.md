# 3.0.3 — Sidebar Navigation Tree

**Epic**: `3 - Collection UX Overhaul`

## Goal
Create a collapsible sidebar navigation component that lists all site sections and sub-sections, enabling lateral navigation between collections without returning to the home page.

## Scope
- **Create Partial** (`partials/collections-tree.html`):
  - Iterate over `{{ .Site.Sections }}` to list top-level categories.
  - For each category, list its sub-sections (collections).
  - Highlight the current collection as "active".
  - Support collapsed/expanded state per section.

- **Integrate into `list.html`**:
  - Add sidebar container in the layout grid.
  - Include the `collections-tree` partial.
  - Ensure sidebar is positioned left or right of gallery (configurable via CSS).

- **JavaScript (optional `sidebar.js`)**:
  - Toggle expand/collapse on section header click.
  - Persist collapsed state in `localStorage` (optional enhancement).
  - On mobile: start collapsed, expand on tap.

- **CSS Updates**:
  - Sidebar container and tree styling.
  - Active collection highlight.
  - Collapsed/expanded icons and animations.
  - Mobile: full-width drawer or slideout pattern.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Sidebar partial renders all site sections and their sub-collections.
- [ ] Current collection is visually highlighted (e.g., bold, background color).
- [ ] Clicking a section header toggles its expanded/collapsed state.
- [ ] Links navigate directly to the target collection page.
- [ ] On desktop: sidebar is visible alongside gallery.
- [ ] On mobile: sidebar is collapsed by default; accessible via tap/toggle.
- [ ] UX does not interfere with gallery scrolling or filter usage.

## Rollback
- Remove the `collections-tree.html` partial.
- Remove sidebar integration from `list.html`.
- Revert associated CSS and JavaScript changes.
