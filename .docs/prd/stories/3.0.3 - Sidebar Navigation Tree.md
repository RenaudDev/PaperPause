# 3.0.3 — Sidebar Navigation Tree

**Epic**: `3 - Collection UX Overhaul`

## Goal
Create a collapsible sidebar navigation component that lists all site sections and sub-sections, enabling lateral navigation between collections without returning to the home page.

## Scope

### Create Partial (`partials/collections-tree.html`)
- Iterate over `{{ .Site.Sections }}` to list top-level categories (e.g., Animals, Fantasy).
- For each category, list its sub-sections (e.g., Dogs, Cats, Horses).
- Highlight the current collection as "active" (bold, accent color).
- Support collapsed/expanded state per section using `<details>`/`<summary>`.
- Match existing filter panel styling for visual consistency.

### Integrate into `list.html`
- Add Collections Tree to the existing `<aside>` sidebar.
- Place ABOVE or BELOW the existing filter `<details>` panel.
- Wrap in its own `<details>` for collapse/expand behavior.

### JavaScript (optional)
- Persist expanded/collapsed state in `localStorage` (optional enhancement).
- Auto-expand the section containing the current collection.

### CSS Updates
- Tree item styling: indentation, hover effects.
- Active collection highlight (teal accent).
- Collapse/expand icons (chevron rotation).
- Match existing sidebar spacing and typography.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Existing filter sidebar unchanged**: Filter panel layout and behavior preserved.
- [ ] Collections Tree partial renders all site sections and their sub-collections.
- [ ] Current collection is visually highlighted (bold, accent color).
- [ ] Clicking a section header toggles its expanded/collapsed state.
- [ ] Links navigate directly to the target collection page.
- [ ] Collections Tree is collapsible (similar to filter panel).
- [ ] On mobile: Collections Tree follows same collapse behavior as filter panel.
- [ ] UX does not interfere with filter usage or gallery scrolling.

## Rollback
- Remove the `collections-tree.html` partial.
- Remove Collections Tree integration from `list.html`.
- Revert associated CSS changes.
