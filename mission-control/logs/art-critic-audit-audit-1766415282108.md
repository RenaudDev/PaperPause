## Detailed Failures
| File | Reason | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `animals\butterflies\20251216-cottagecore-butterflies-coloring-pages-7744.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The butterfly exhibits nonsensical anatomy with legs sprouting from the head/neck area rather than the thorax. Additionally, there are AI artifacts in the background where mushroom stems merge unnaturally into leaf outlines, particularly in the bottom-left corner. |
| `animals\butterflies\20251217-bold-line-pop-art-butterflies-coloring-pages-5436.md` | **GRAYSCALE_SHADING** | The upper wing section contains several faint, light-gray lines and 'ghost' artifacts that are not solid black. This violates the requirement for pure black-and-white line art and would be difficult for a user to color over or ignore. |
| `animals\butterflies\20251218-great-spangled-fritillary-butterfly-flower-kids.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The butterfly's anatomy is nonsensical; the thorax and leg area are a jumbled cluster of lines that lack coherent structure, which would be confusing and frustrating for a user to color. |
| `animals\butterflies\20251219-swallowtail-butterfly-flying-clouds-for-adults.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The butterfly exhibits nonsensical AI-generated anatomy, specifically extreme asymmetry where the left wing has an elongated, swirling tail while the right wing lacks one entirely. Additionally, the thorax and leg area is a disorganized jumble of lines that lacks clear structure. |
| `animals\butterflies\20251221-mourning-cloak-butterfly-flower-field-kids.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The image contains nonsensical geometry and AI artifacts. Specifically, the butterfly's middle leg is intersected by the outline of the flower's center, and the leg attachments to the body are poorly defined and anatomically incorrect, which would be confusing for a user to color. |
| `animals\butterflies\20251222-banded-peacock-butterfly-flowers-for-adults.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The line work within the butterfly's wings is excessively dense and intricate, making it nearly impossible to color with standard markers or crayons without bleeding across lines. Furthermore, the 'eye' spots on the wings contain messy, inconsistent geometry and some fine-line shading that creates a grayscale effect. |
| `animals\cats\20251215-cat-1765795104088-2.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The knitted scarf features an extremely dense pattern with lines spaced too closely for standard markers or crayons, which would lead to ink bleeding and a frustrating coloring experience. Additionally, the cat's right paw lacks anatomical definition, appearing as a simplified AI artifact. |
| `animals\cats\20251215-cat-1765795127292-3.md` | **TEXT_PRESENT** | The book spines, both in the central stack and on the background bookshelf, contain blurry pseudo-text and illegible characters that violate the strict no-text policy. |
| `animals\cats\20251215-cat-1765796880189-0.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The kitten's right paw is rendered as an amorphous blob that merges unnaturally with the spoon handle. Additionally, the apron tie on the left appears to be floating or disconnected from the main garment, which are clear AI artifacts unsuitable for a premium collection. |
| `animals\cats\20251216-kawaii-cats-coloring-pages-2076.md` | **TEXT_PRESENT** | The image contains the word 'BAKERY' on the overhead sign. Per the strict quality criteria, any visible text or letters result in an immediate failure. |
| `animals\cats\20251217-kawaii-cats-coloring-pages-4894.md` | **TEXT_PRESENT** | The image contains prominent, legible text on the wall sign ('SWEET TREATS') and the book cover ('BAKERY TALES'), which violates the strict no-text policy for professional coloring pages. |
| `animals\cats\20251218-tuxedo-cat-reading-book-art-studio-for-adults.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The image contains several AI artifacts: the classical bust on the left has a distorted, 'melted' face; the cat's paws holding the book lack proper anatomical structure; and the swirling patterns on the cat's fur are inconsistent and appear as nonsensical geometry rather than texture. |
| `animals\cats\20251219-playful-cat-chasing-butterflies-adult-coloring.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The cat's anatomy is nonsensical, specifically the attachment and shape of the hind leg which appears detached from the torso. Additionally, the window frame geometry is inconsistent and broken behind the cat's body. |
| `animals\cats\20251220-ragdoll-cat-napping-window-sill-for-kids.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The cat's facial features are poorly defined and cluttered with overlapping, nonsensical lines that make the expression indistinguishable. Additionally, the window frame contains several floating, disconnected lines and inconsistent geometry that detracts from the overall quality. |
| `animals\cats\20251222-persian-cat-painting-easel-forest-adults.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The line density in the cat's fur and the painting on the easel is far too high. The intricate swirling patterns are too tight for standard coloring tools like markers or crayons, which would cause significant bleeding and a frustrating user experience. |
| `animals\dogs\20251215-adventurous-dog-coloring-page-4171.md` | **OPEN_PATHS** | The flower pot on the right side of the image has a significant gap in its left-side outline, which would cause a 'flood fill' or marker bleed into the background bushes. Additionally, the dog's tail area and the bench geometry exhibit nonsensical AI artifacts. |
| `animals\dogs\20251215-curious-dog-coloring-page-7534.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The dog's paws exhibit nonsensical geometry and inconsistency: the right paw (viewer's left) resembles a human hand with a thumb, while the left paw (viewer's right) is a featureless stump. Additionally, the cookies on the tray and sand mound are poorly defined, messy blobs that lack the clean line art quality required. |
| `animals\dogs\20251215-Dog-1765812945826-0.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The image contains several AI artifacts that compromise the quality. Specifically, the butterfly on the right has mangled, nonsensical wing geometry. The dog's paws are poorly rendered, with the back paw showing disconnected pads and the front paws appearing as indistinct stumps. Furthermore, the sweater pattern is excessively dense, which borders on the TOO_COMPLEX failure criteria for standard coloring tools. |
| `animals\dogs\20251215-Dog-1765815981423-1.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The pug has a human-like hand with five digits holding the paintbrush, which is a clear AI artifact. Additionally, the paintbrush handle is misaligned and changes thickness as it passes through the hand. |
| `animals\dogs\20251215-grumpy-dog-coloring-page-0623.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The newspaper on the floor contains extremely dense, fine parallel lines that are too tight for a standard marker or crayon to color between. Additionally, the dog's right limb is anatomically awkward, appearing to emerge from the center of the chest. |
| `animals\dogs\20251215-zen-dog-coloring-page-3539.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The image contains several AI artifacts: the dog's right paw holding the spoon is a nonsensical blob, the stove knobs are inconsistent in shape and size, and the jar lids on the shelf are distorted. Additionally, the wood grain on the cabinetry is excessively dense, which would be difficult to color. |
| `animals\dogs\20251216-totem-dogs-coloring-pages-9136.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The line density within the dog's coat and the sun mandala is excessively high. Many of the white spaces are too narrow for standard markers or crayons, which will lead to ink bleeding and a frustrating experience for the user. |
| `animals\dogs\20251218-corgi-chewing-shoe-at-home-for-adults.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The line density on the dog's coat and the sneaker is excessively high. Many of the white spaces are too narrow for standard coloring tools, which would lead to ink bleeding and a frustrating user experience. Additionally, the sneaker laces exhibit nonsensical geometry typical of AI artifacts. |
| `animals\dogs\20251219-west-highland-white-terrier-morning-glory-flowers.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The fur texture on the dog is rendered with excessively fine and dense line work. These gaps are too narrow for standard markers or crayons, which would cause ink to bleed across the lines and frustrate the user. |
| `animals\dogs\20251220-dalmatian-dog-howling-garden-flowers-adults.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The image contains significant AI artifacts and nonsensical geometry. Specifically, the back right paw is a cluster of incoherent shapes rather than a foot, and the interior of the mouth contains messy, unidentifiable lines that break the clean aesthetic required for a premium product. |
| `animals\dogs\20251222-dachshund-howling-kitchen-coloring-page-for-adults.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The dog's rear paws exhibit significant AI artifacts, including nonsensical toe structures and messy line clusters. Additionally, the kitchen fixtures show inconsistent geometry, such as mismatched stove knobs and a poorly defined faucet assembly. |
| `animals\horses\20251216-elegant-horse-coloring-page-7834.md` | **OPEN_PATHS** | Several critical lines defining the horse's anatomy do not connect to the main body, specifically where the legs meet the chest and belly. Additionally, many background lines for the hills and grass are left hanging, which creates 'rivers' of white space that would frustrate a user trying to color distinct sections. |
| `animals\horses\20251216-totem-horses-coloring-pages-4897.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The horse's anatomy contains significant AI artifacts, specifically in the hooves and legs. The hooves vary wildly in size and shape (ranging from large and flat to tiny and pointed), and the rear-left leg is disproportionately small and positioned unnaturally relative to the horse's body. |
| `animals\horses\20251217-cottagecore-horses-coloring-pages-4899.md` | **TEXT_PRESENT** | The image contains prominent text on a sign reading 'GRUMPY'S STABLE', which is a direct violation of the quality standards. |
| `animals\horses\20251218-clydesdale-horse-grazing-desert-adults.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The lines in the horse's mane and the vertical ribbing on the saguaro cacti are extremely dense and fine. These areas are too intricate for standard markers or crayons to color without bleeding across lines. Additionally, there are anatomical inconsistencies in the horse's legs, particularly the front-left leg (viewer's left) which has an unnatural joint structure. |
| `animals\horses\20251219-patterned-horse-walking-woodland-adults.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The horse's anatomy contains significant AI artifacts, specifically in the legs and hooves which are rendered as nonsensical swirls or deformed shapes rather than proper equine anatomy. Additionally, the pattern density on the horse's face and neck is too high, making it difficult to color without bleeding. |
| `animals\horses\20251220-morgan-horse-in-stable-for-kids.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The image contains nonsensical geometry in the background. Specifically, the 'X' bracing on the stable door is broken and does not align with the door frame, and the fence rails on the left side of the horse do not continue logically on the right side. |
| `animals\horses\20251221-american-paint-horse-galloping-racetrack-kids.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The horse exhibits anatomical errors, particularly in the front right leg which appears double-jointed and the back left hoof which is poorly defined. Additionally, the background 'stadium stands' consist of nonsensical, jagged geometric patterns that do not resemble a real structure and create a cluttered, unappealing composition. |
| `animals\sharks\20251217-kawaii-sharks-coloring-pages-7981.md` | **BAD_AESTHETIC** | The image contains nonsensical geometry: the far pectoral fin is incorrectly attached to the shark's throat/neck area rather than the side of the body. Additionally, the tail fin structure is poorly formed, and the 'cute' cartoon style completely fails to meet the 'fierce' requirement of the prompt. |
| `animals\sharks\20251218-baby-shark-surfing-wave-beach-adults.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The decorative filigree patterns on the shark's body and the surfboard are extremely dense. The line spacing in these areas is too narrow for standard markers or crayons, which would result in ink bleeding and a frustrating experience for the user. |
| `animals\sharks\20251220-hammerhead-shark-leaping-waves-adults.md` | **TOO_COMPLEX** | The internal mandala patterns are excessively dense, featuring microscopic details and thin lines that would be impossible to color with standard markers or crayons without bleeding. Furthermore, the hammerhead shark exhibits anatomical AI artifacts, specifically a missing eye and distorted shape on the left side of its head. |
| `animals\sharks\20251222-zen-whale-shark-coral-reef-adults.md` | **OPEN_PATHS** | The image contains numerous open paths where lines do not meet to form closed shapes. Specifically, the wavy lines at the top and several sections of the coral on the left and bottom-right consist of 'floating' lines that do not enclose space, making it impossible for a user to color those specific elements without the color bleeding into the background. |
